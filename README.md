# members_only
An express project based on the description of this course's page: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only

This project has the following features described in the Odin Project course page:

```
By this point, anyone who comes to the site should be able to see a list of all messages, with the authorâ€™s name hidden. Users should be able to sign-up and create messages, but ONLY users that are members should be able to see the author of each message. Finally, you should have an Admin user that is able to see everything and also has the ability to delete messages. Obviously this is a simple and silly little app, but the things you are practicing (creating and authenticating users and giving users different abilities and permissions) are things that will be very useful to you!
